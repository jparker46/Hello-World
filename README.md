# Hello-World
Testing for HINQ302, creating my first repo

## Creating a heading

* Creating some bullet points 
* and another 
* and another 

This is so much fun.  I love this program.  It is totally better and not at all more complicated than the programs that I am presently using, that of course, need replacing.

I can see it's merit, but I also have existing solutions that I have not problem with.  I guess it will take a bit of using to see if I think this is worth it or not.
